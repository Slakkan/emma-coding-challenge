1) Install docker: https://www.docker.com/get-started
2) Extract env.rar in this folder
3) Open your terminal of choice in this folder and run: docker-compose up
4) Go to http://localhost:4200/ in your favorite browser

All set! wait a few minutes for docker to generate the image and create the containers.

Next executions will be a lot faster as the image is cached.

If you need to make changes to the package.json of any folder to add a dependency, stop
the containers with CTR+C or CMD+C on mac and run: docker-compose up --build

If you have build the images a couple of times, clear all the cached images as they will
start to take a lot of space in your disk and the only image we care is the latest one.
To clear all the cached images use: docker system prune
